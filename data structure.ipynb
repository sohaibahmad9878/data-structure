    "1.Efficient Append and Pop Operations:\n",

    "Scenario: Function Call Stack in a Program\n",
    "When a program runs, each function call is added to a call stack. The stack operates in a\n",
    "Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner, which means the most recent function called must finish \n",
    "execution before the previous ones can resume. Here's why a stack is ideal in this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1.Function Invocation: When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack.\n",
    "The function at the top of the stack is the one currently executing.\n",
    "2.Function Returns: When the function completes, it is popped from the stack, and control\n",
    "returns to the next function below it.\n",
    "3.Maintaining State: Each function call can store its local variables and state, ensuring\n",
    "that when it returns, its context is preserved without interfering with other function\n",
    "calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Recursion in Calculating Factorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In recursive algorithms (like calculating factorial), the function calls itself, and each call must wait for the next recursive call to complete. The stack helps manage this series of calls efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why a stack over a list?\n",
    ".A stack inherently provides the LIFO behavior, which aligns perfectly with the function\n",
    "call process.\n",
    ".A list, although capable of similar functionality (using append and pop),\n",
    "doesn't have a specific enforcement of the LIFO discipline, and might be more prone to\n",
    "misuse where order is important.\n",
    " Thus, the stack is ideal for this kind of task, ensuring proper control flow in recursive\n",
    " or nested function scenarios."
